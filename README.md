# SuperVoice — Voice Agent (local demo)

Configurable voice agent demo for **SuperVoice**: Pipecat pipeline with **Deepgram** (STT/TTS), **Google Gemini** (LLM), and **Priya** sales persona. Includes a **browser Studio** to configure and run test calls on a Mac (mic + speakers).

**Repository:** [SuperVoice-Voice-AI-Agent-Platform](https://github.com/abhijeet1490/SuperVoice-Voice-AI-Agent-Platform)

Product requirements and roadmap live in [`docs/PRD-V1.md`](docs/PRD-V1.md).

---

## Prerequisites (Mac)

- macOS with microphone and speakers (or headphones; loudspeaker mode uses echo guard)
- Python 3.12+
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for PortAudio): `brew install portaudio`
- API keys:
  - [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/) — STT + TTS
  - [Google AI / Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — LLM

---

## First-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijeet1490/SuperVoice-Voice-AI-Agent-Platform.git
cd SuperVoice-Voice-AI-Agent-Platform
```

Copy the example file, then enter your own keys in `.env` (never commit this file):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

Install Python dependencies and local audio support:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh run_studio.sh
./run.sh
```

The first run creates `.venv`, installs packages (including PyAudio), and starts the agent. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop. You only need this once to bootstrap the environment (or if Setup in Studio reports a missing venv).

---

## Daily use — SuperVoice Studio (recommended)

Start the dashboard:

```bash
./run_studio.sh
```

Opens **http://127.0.0.1:8765** in your browser.

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Control** | Start / stop / restart test call; save settings |
| **Setup** | Checklist (`.env`, venv, PyAudio) — fix before first Start |
| **Settings** | LLM, STT, TTS voice, VAD, turn-taking, speaker echo guard |
| **Prompt** | System prompt (empty = default Priya prompt in code) |
| **Session** | Live transcript + technical logs |

**Typical flow:** Setup (all green) → Settings / Prompt → **Save settings** → **Start test call** → allow microphone → **Stop** when done.

Stopping Studio with **Ctrl+C** closes only the UI. Use **Stop** in the Control tab to end the voice agent.

---

## Terminal-only (no browser)

```bash
./run.sh
```

Uses settings from [`config/agent_runtime.json`](config/agent_runtime.json). Stop with **Ctrl+C**.

---

## How configuration works

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| [`config/agent_runtime.json`](config/agent_runtime.json) | Saved settings from Studio (models, VAD, delays, prompt override) |
| [`agents/configs/priya_agent.py`](agents/configs/priya_agent.py) | Code defaults when JSON omits a field |
| `.env` | API keys only (local, gitignored) |

After changing settings in Studio, click **Save**. If a call is already running, use **Restart with saved settings** on the Control tab.

## Voice pipeline (high level)

```text
Microphone → VAD → Deepgram STT → (turn logic) → Gemini → Deepgram TTS → Speakers
```

While the agent is speaking, **half-duplex** listening reduces loudspeaker echo on Mac. Real phone deployments will use telephony + platform AEC; this local demo is tuned for product iteration.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Studio Setup fails on venv | Run `./run.sh` once |
| `No module named 'pyaudio'` | `brew install portaudio` then `.venv/bin/pip install 'pipecat-ai[local]==1.3.0'` |
| Deepgram STT 400 on connect | Use `stt_model: nova-2-general` in Settings; avoid invalid STT flag combos |
| Agent cuts off on speaker | Increase **Speaker echo guard tail** in Settings; prefer headphones for testing |
| Changes not applied | Save settings, then **Restart** the agent |

---

## Git workflow

```bash
git pull origin main
# edit, test via Studio
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin main
```

Do **not** commit `.env` or `.venv/`.

For a fresh local checkout without Git history, initialize and review the staged files before pushing:

```bash
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/abhijeet1490/SuperVoice-Voice-AI-Agent-Platform.git
git add .
git diff --cached --name-only
# Confirm .env, .venv/, credentials, and private call data are absent.
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

These fresh-history commands assume the destination repository is empty. If it already has commits, reconcile its history before pushing.

## Local demo security

Studio binds to `127.0.0.1` and has no authentication. Keep it local; adding authentication and request protections is required before exposing it on a network.

Microphone audio and conversation text are sent to the configured speech and LLM providers. Session transcripts appear in Studio logs. Keep real customer information, recordings, and private prompts out of committed files, including `config/agent_runtime.json`.
